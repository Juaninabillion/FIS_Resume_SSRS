<h1>Thank you for visiting!</h1>
This Resume SSRS repo houses an attempt to create a real resume from SQL Server Reporting Services. I installed SSMS on my local machine and created the database
as well as its corresponding objects. This includes all the tables, stored procedures and all the data. These are the bones to an application I would like to write
that can help organize resume writing and creation. with standard templates for data, the only necessary imput from the user would be their personal history. 
The SSRS should allow for customizable templates that give the user a way to create profesional grade resumes at the touch of a button
